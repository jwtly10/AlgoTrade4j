# AlgoTrade4j

üèóÔ∏è Note this is a WIP project, and is not ready for production use yet. Documentation also WIP. üèóÔ∏è

AlgoTrade4j is a complete, high-performance algorithmic trading platform for Java, designed to be simple yet opinionated. Originally built to port strategies from MQL (MetaTrader4) to Java, it offers robust and flexible ways to backtest and extend functionality. The platform is capable of processing 50,000 ticks per second, making it suitable for high-frequency trading strategies.

‚ö†Ô∏èThis is currently bespoke implementation so may not be suitable for all use cases.

Here is a small video demo of the system. You can interact directly with this [demo site]() (TODO).

## Key Features:

- Event-driven architecture for responsive strategy execution
- External API integration for fetching bar data from multiple providers
- Synthetic tick generation from acquired bar data for enhanced price movement granularity
- Real-time updates via WebSockets and event publishers
- REST APIs for seamless external integrations
- High-performance processing (capable of handling 50,000+ ticks/second)
- Comprehensive test coverage (90%+ in core)
- Integrated frontend for strategy management and execution
- Dynamic strategy parameter system for flexible configuration
- Advanced optimization tools for efficient backtesting
- Robust authentication and authorization system

## Architecture

The framework consists of 4 main components:

1. Core Module: Contains the main trading logic, event system and implemented defaults
2. API Module: A Spring-based REST API for handling external requests and WebSocket connections
3. Market Data Module: Manages the integration with external market data providers.
4. React Frontend Module: A React-based frontend providing a user interface for interacting with the system.

The system utilizes an event-driven architecture with a global event publisher for external communications.

## Getting started

### Usage (AlgoTrade4j-Core)

AlgoTrade4j-Core is the main logic module of the platform. It can be extended to create custom indicators, strategies or backtest engines. Some defaults have been created, which are used by default. Below is a brief overview of how you can implement your own strategies. Full documentation [here](). (TODO)

#### Strategies

To create new strategies you must extend the `BaseStrategy` [class](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/strategy/BaseStrategy.java).

And implement the 'OnTick', 'OnBarClose' methods at minimum. And example of a strategy is [here](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/strategy/SMACrossoverStrategy.java).

AlgoTrade4j supports dynamic strategy configuration through a custom annotation system. Strategy parameters can be defined using the `@Parameter` annotation:

```java
 // Risk parameters
@Parameter(name = "riskRatio", description = "Risk ratio of SL to TP", value = "5", group = "risk")
private int riskRatio;

// Indicator parameters
@Parameter(name = "atrLength", description = "Length of ATR", value = "14", group = "indicator")
private int atrLength;
```

These annotated parameters are exposed via an API, allowing for dynamic updates at runtime. This feature enables:

- Real-time strategy adjustments without recompilation, via the frontend
- Rapid prototyping and optimization of trading strategies

You can modify strategy behavior on-the-fly, significantly reducing the development and testing cycle for new trading ideas.

#### Indicators

To create new Indicators you must implement the `Indicator` [interface](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/indicators/Indicator.java).

Note indicators in this framework are very opinionated. This works for the indicators that I use, but may not work for all of them. Some indicators have already been implemented in `dev.jwtly10.core.indicators`.
[Example SMA](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/indicators/iSMA.java)

Indicator params can be paired with strategy `@Parameter`'s as mentioned above, to change Indicator settings on-the-fly.

#### Market Data

Currently, only Oanda has been supported. You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-market-data/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/marketdata/dataclients/OandaDataClient.java). To implement new clients, the `ExternalDataClient` [interface](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-market-data/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/marketdata/common/ExternalDataClient.java) must be implemented (The Oanda client was an example). Supported
symbols and Instrument meta data can be found [here](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/model/Instrument.java).
