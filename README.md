# AlgoTrade4j

üèóÔ∏è Note: Currently a work in progress and not yet ready for production live trading üèóÔ∏è

AlgoTrade4j is a complete (supporting strategy-dev, backtesting, optimising and live trading), high-performance algorithmic trading platform for Java, designed to be opinionated but simple.

Originally built to port strategies from MQL (MetaTrader4) to Java, it offers robust and flexible ways to backtest and extend functionality. The platform is capable of processing 50,000 ticks per second, making it suitable for complex strategy logic, on low timeframes.

Here is a small video demo of the system.

## Currently Supported Broker Integrations

- Oanda - https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/
- MT5 via custom REST Adapter API - https://github.com/jwtly10/algotrade4j_mt5

## Architecture

The framework consists of 5 main components:

1. `Core Module`: Contains the main trading logic, event system and implemented defaults
2. `Backtest-api Module`: A Spring REST API for handling backtesting operations and core system operations
3. `Live-api Module`: A Spring service for live trading, and other broker related operations
4. `Market-data Module`: Manages the integration with external market data providers.
5. `Frontend React Module`: A React-based frontend providing a base user interface for interacting with the system.

And there a few external custom add-ons:

- [jwtly10/Algotrade4j_mt5](https://github.com/jwtly10/algotrade4j_mt5) - Broker adapter for MT5
- [jwtly10/Algotrade4j_py](https://github.com/jwtly10/algotrade4j_py) - Python SDK for AT4J market data, direct support for [backtesting.py](https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py)

This is a high-level overview of the framework and how it handles strategies:

- A data provider is initialised with the data that needs to be listened to (e.g. Broker price streams, or historical API data).
- A data manager is wrapper around this data provider, to transform raw data into ticks & bars.
- A data listener/executor is then created to listen to callbacks from the data manager. This interface handles the data, and orchestrates other flows that are required for running a strategy:
    - Handles updating account data (PNL, balance, etc)
    - Handles updating trade stats (open trades, closed trades, etc)
    - Emits events to the running strategy instance.
- A strategy is then created, and the data listener is attached to it. The strategy is then run on the data listener, and the users strategy logic is executed on each event.

Each part of the system has access to the global async event publisher to support real-time updates and external communications.

## Getting started

### Usage (AlgoTrade4j-Core Library)

AlgoTrade4j-Core is the main logic module of the platform. It can be extended to create custom indicators, strategies or backtest engines. Some defaults have been created, which are used by default. Below is a brief overview of how you can implement your own strategies.

Full documentation [here](https://jwtly10.github.io/AlgoTrade4j/).

#### Strategies

To create new strategies you must extend the `BaseStrategy` [class](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/strategy/BaseStrategy.java).

And implement the 'OnTick', 'OnBarClose' methods at minimum. And example of a strategy is [here](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/strategy/SMACrossoverStrategy.java).

AlgoTrade4j supports dynamic strategy configuration through a custom annotation system. Strategy parameters can be defined using the `@Parameter` annotation:

```java
 // Risk parameters
@Parameter(name = "riskRatio", description = "Risk ratio of SL to TP", value = "5", group = "risk")
private int riskRatio;

// Indicator parameters
@Parameter(name = "atrLength", description = "Length of ATR", value = "14", group = "indicator")
private int atrLength;

// Trade parameters
@Parameter(name = "tradeDirection", description = "Direction to trade", value = "ANY", enumClass = TradeDir.class, group = "trade")
private TradeDir tradeDirection;

public enum TradeDir {
    LONG, SHORT, ANY
}
```

These annotated parameters are exposed via an API, allowing for dynamic updates at runtime. This feature enables:

- Real-time strategy adjustments without recompilation, via the frontend
- Rapid prototyping and optimization of trading strategies
- Real-time validation of strategy parameters and behavior

You can modify strategy behavior on-the-fly, significantly reducing the development and testing cycle for new trading ideas.

#### Indicators

To create new Indicators you must implement the `Indicator` [interface](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/indicators/Indicator.java).

Currently, indicators only trigger on BarClose. This will be refined in future to be supported on tick where needed. Some indicators have already been implemented in `dev.jwtly10.core.indicators`.
[Example SMA](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/indicators/iSMA.java)

Indicator params can be paired with strategy `@Parameter`'s as mentioned above, to change Indicator settings on-the-fly.

#### Market Data

Currently, only Oanda has been supported. You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-market-data/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/marketdata/dataclients/OandaDataClient.java). To implement new clients, the `ExternalDataClient` [interface](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-market-data/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/marketdata/common/ExternalDataClient.java) must be implemented (The Oanda client was an example). Supported
symbols and Instrument meta data can be found [here](https://github.com/jwtly10/AlgoTrade4j/blob/main/algotrade4j-core/src/main/java/dev/jwtly10/core/model/Instrument.java).

### Running the application stack

#### Dev

*Backend*

The simplest way to run the application locally is through creating a Dockerized Postgres DB and running the application in Intellij.

To create a Postgres DB:

```shell
docker run --name algotrade4j-postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=algotrade4j-db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

Ensure the SQL in ./db has been run on the Database in schema algotrade4j, and all migration patches have been run.

Intellij Setup for both the backtest-api and live-api:

- Profile:
    - dev
- Environment Vars:
    - see .env-example for required vars

Properties are defined in the respective application.properties files.

*Frontend*

```shell
# From project root
cd ./algotrade4j-frontend
npm run dev
```

All supported environment vars can be found here: ./algotrade4j-frontend/.env-example

The frontend application should be running at localhost:5173, with the main-api running on localhost:8080 and live-api running on localhost:8081.

#### Creating new prod instances

The build steps (CI/CD) are defined in the .github/workflows folder. Docker images are built and pushed to docker hub which can be used to deploy the application anywhere.

The docker-compose setup should allow for deploying to new environments with minimal changes.

Requirements:

- Docker
- Docker compose
- Nginx
